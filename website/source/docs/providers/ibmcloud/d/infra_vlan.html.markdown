# ibmcloud\_infra_vlan


Import the details of an existing VLAN as a read-only data source. The fields of the data source can then be referenced by other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax. 


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibmcloud_infra_vlan" "vlan_foo" {
    name = "FOO"
}
```


The following example shows how you can use this data source to reference a VLAN ID in the _ibmcloud_infra_bare_metal_ resource, since the numeric IDs are often unknown.

```hcl
resource "ibmcloud_infra_bare_metal" "bm1" {
    ...
    public_vlan_id = "${data.ibmcloud_infra_vlan.vlan_foo.id}"
    ...
}
```
