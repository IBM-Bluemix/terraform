# ibmcloud\_cf_space

Import the details of an existing IBM Bluemix space as a read-only data source. The fields of the data source can then be referenced by other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax. 

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibmcloud_cf_space" "spaceData" {
  space = "prod"
  org   = "someexample.com"
}
```

The following example shows how you can use the data source to reference the space ID in the `ibmcloud_cf_service_instance` resource.

```hcl
resource "ibmcloud_cf_service_instance" "service_instance" {
  name              = "test"
  space_guid        = "${data.ibmcloud_cf_space.spaceData.id}"
  service           = "cloudantNOSQLDB"
  plan              = "Lite"
  tags              = ["cluster-service", "cluster-bind"]
}

```
